> Last year I took part in an online scikit-learn sprint organised by Data Umbrella and it helped me a lot with getting started to contribute to this library. The community is very friendly and supportive and contributing to scikit-learn strengthened my professional profile which helped me to get job interviews with good companies. So if you know someone from Africa or the Middle East who might be interested, please share with them. :)

## Sprint Background

This sprint was organized by [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org) to increase the participation of underrepresented persons in data science, with a focus on the geographic regions of Africa and the Middle East (AFME).  

This report focuses on the summary, impact and lessons learned of the AFME scikit-learn sprint.  


## Demographics

<p>
 <img src="../assets/images/2021-afme/afme-graphs.png" width="99%" height="99%" style="border:0px;margin:0px">
</p>

A total of 31 contributors attended the sprint. 12 of 31 (39%) identified at female or non-binary.  18 of 31 (58%) identified as male.  

Contributors joined from 14 different countries.  Country information was provided based on where participants were joining from. Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Nigeria had the most participants, for a total of 16 of 31, almost 55%.

 Other countries represented include Morocco, South Africa, Ghana, Iran, Congo, Malawi, as well as Sweden and France.

Given the migration in the region, these other countries were also represented in terms of contributor background:  Sudan, Turkey, Syria. 

There were two invited contributors, joining from India and Germany.  Invited contributors were those who participated in a prior sprint and have continued contributing to scikit-learn.  They were paired with a new contributor.  

### Spoken Languages
All communication was in English. All participants felt comfortable conversing in English. Languages spoken by participants included:  English, Arabic, French, Kishwahli, Persian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish and German.

### Open Source Background
Two-thirds of participants identified as having "none" or "beginner" level experience in contributing to open source. 


### Number of Participants
- About 15 participants joined the pre-sprint event
- 31 participants joined the sprint
- 7 participants joined the post-sprint event

Post-sprint event well.  Programming partners disappeared.  They have been contributing after the sprint.

The participa
To ensure that attendees had some knowledge of Python and scikit-learn, a brief application form was used.  Attendees did not have to be experienced Git users, but some experience was helpful.  

About 25% of the attendees had participated in a scikit-learn open source sprint before.  The attendees were evenly split by gender.  Participants from **ten different countries** joined. Over half the participants identified as "underrepresented."

Most attendees learned of the event via Twitter and word-of-mouth, followed by scikit-learn GitHub repo and then through other social media and community platforms (e.g. Slack, Meetup, LinkedIn, etc.)

## Preparation Work
Because this was a virtual event and the idea of having an 8-hour online sprint was not appealing (to me), I reduced the time in half and increased the preparation work that attendees could do.

There are two videos for newcomers to [Get Started with Contributing to Scikit-learn](https://www.dataumbrella.org/open-source/contributing-to-scikit-learn):  
- Andreas Mueller: [Crash Course in Contributing to Scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL8XoMMOfA)
- Reshama Shaikh: [Contributing to Scikit-Learn: An Example Pull Request](https://youtu.be/PU1WyDPGePI)

**Added Bonus:** Many people who discovered these resources from social media and were not participating in the sprint watched the videos and began submitting PRs.  The goal was to make contributing accessible to a larger pool of people.

</p>

## Challenges for Me, as an Organizer
Participants can use a variety of different (user) names (and nicknames) for email, Discord, GitHub, social media, etc.  It is challenging to connect their different profiles and assist them, and it makes getting to know participants more time-consuming and difficult. 

## Challenges

### Technology Platforms
For a typical in-person sprint, interaction is in person and some communication in the scikit-learn sprint Gitter channel.

For the virtual event, the following platforms were utilized, which would also limit any costs required to use:  
1.  **Zoom:** for presentation: being online from 11:45 am EDT to about 12:15 pm EDT (because Discord has max of only 25 people in any one channel, and we have about 50 people joining)
2.  **Discord:** during sprint time
3.  **Gitter:**  use after sprint (Typically our sprints are in person, so sprint participants would ask in person or on Gitter.)  There are more core scikit-learn contributors on Gitter than on this Discord.  But, typically, if the question is related to a specific pull request (PR), the conversation is on the GitHub PR.

### Pair Programming
About 8 people were no-shows, and their pairs needed to be reassigned at the start of the event.

### Discord
Discord is a platform which is unfamiliar to some people and there was a learning curve in navigating it.  

### Applicant Responsivity 
Over 80 applicants were sent acceptances and half did not RSVP. Partial reasons is that the sprint emails were going to spam folders.

### Virtual Environment Setup for Windows
A number of Windows users experienced challenges in setting up their virtual environment.

## Pair Programming
This was an entirely online event.  Participants were assigned their partner prior to sprint start.  Where possible, a new contributor was matched with a returning contributor.

## Follow-up Office Hours
Office hours were set up 2 weeks after the sprint where some of the scikit-learn core contributors were available to answer questions on open PRs.  The office hours were scheduled for 7am PDT / 10am EDT /  5pm EAT / 7:30pm IST.


## Non-measurable Impact
Aside from the number of PRs that were merged, there is non-quantifiable impact of the open source sprint. Some examples include:
- learning to set up virtual environment
- using Git (fork, clone, branch, fetching another's PR)
- introduction to tests such as:  flake8 (linting, formatting), pytest, "continuous integration"
- navigating through the codebase structure of scikit-learn
- digging into functions, learning about errors
- learning about unit tests
- interacting with contributors on GitHub
- learning, in general
- networking
- building confidence (making a dent in "imposter syndrome")
- having fun


## Sprint Feedback

Feedback has been shared a number of ways:  
- Twitter [Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1269710860202770434)
- Blogs
- Sprint survey
- Casually, in conversation during the sprint

## Adjustments for Next Sprint

### Application Form: reminder for spam
Remind participants that communication is sent from other platforms (Mailchimp, Eventbrite, etc) and it may go to spam.  It would be good to keep an eye out on the spam folder or email the sprint organizer if they have not heard back. 

### Application Form:  pronouns 
Ask for preferred pronoun on application and also to include on website for contributors.

### Issues
Add in a slide to explain to participants how to look for issues to work on.

### Pair Programming
Add in a slide explaining how pair programming works.

### Second Pull Request
Update slides / documentation to show how to submit a second PR.

### Pair Partner
Explore how to optimally match participants as pair partners based on experience.  

### Platforms
Three platforms (Zoom, Discord and Gitter) were confusing for attendees.  One platform was preferred. 

### Scikit-learn Mailing List
Include link to [scikit-learn mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/scikit-learn) in communications.  Encourage participants to sign up for the mailing list to keep up to date on discussions.  The mailing list is also a good way to learn about open source, the library and the community.

### Setting up virtual environment
We encouraged people to set up their virtual environment beforehand. The dilemna here is if we make it optional, more people probably would not do it.  If we make it required, people who do not set up beforehand may not attend the sprint.  Some people had difficulty setting up their environment and thought they could only join the sprint if their set up was ready. Action: find a way to optimize set up before the sprint while providing support for those who need it.

### Discord categories
For each virtual table, use categories to group table for chat and voice. The current setup does not have voice and chat for each table adjacent to each other.
