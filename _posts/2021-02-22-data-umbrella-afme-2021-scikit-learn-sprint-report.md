# Reminders

- submit draft report to core contributors for review
- add screenshot of checklist and link to it.

## Sprint Background
A "sprint" is a hands-on hackathon where participants learn to contribute to scikit-learn, a well-known Python open source, machine learning library.

This sprint was organized by [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org) to increase the participation of underrepresented persons in data science, with a focus on the geographic regions of Africa and the Middle East (AFME).  



This report focuses on the summary, impact and lessons learned of the AFME scikit-learn sprint.  

## Event Sponsor
This event was funded in part by a grant from Code for Science & Society, made possible by grant number [GBMF8449](https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF8449) from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

## Continued Contribution to Open Source
This sprint was a 4-hour block of time with pre- and post-sprint work required. 

Participants are encouraged to keep contributing to scikit-learn or other Python libraries, using the skills learned in this event. 


## Sprint Agenda
- 30-Jan-2021:  pre-sprint Kickoff  (10am to 11am EAT)  [a]
- 06-Feb-2021:  Sprint  (10am to 2pm EAT)  [b]
- 20-Feb-2021:  Sprint Follow-up Office Hours (10am to 11am EAT)

[a] EAT = East Africa Time
[b] Even though the event ended at 2pm EAT, participants continued to work on their sprint PRs (pull requests) throughout the day and weekend. Also, many scikit-learn core contributors were online to review the PRs.  

### Sprint Day
Even though the sprint ran 4 hours (10am to 2pm EAT),, participants continued to work on their sprint PRs (pull requests) throughout the day and weekend. Also, many scikit-learn core contributors were online to review the PRs.  

### Follow-up Office Hours
Office hours were set up 2 weeks after the sprint where some of the scikit-learn core contributors were available to answer questions on open PRs.  

## Number of Attendees
- Pre-sprint event: 15
- Sprint day: 31
- Post-sprint office hours:  7

## Preparation Work
Because this was a virtual event and the idea of having an 8-hour online sprint was not appealing (to me), I reduced the time in half and increased the preparation work that attendees could do.

There are two videos for newcomers to [Get Started with Contributing to Scikit-learn](https://www.dataumbrella.org/open-source/contributing-to-scikit-learn):

## Sprint Feedback

Feedback has been shared a number of ways:  
- Twitter [Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1358408128753238017)
- Blogs
- Sprint survey
- Social media (LinkedIn)
- Casually, in conversation during the sprint, pre-sprint and post-sprint events

## Data Umbrella Feedback Survey
Data Umbrella received 19 responses to our internal sprint survey. (19/31 = 61% response rate).

Respondents rated their overall sprint experience highly favorably and had a positive experience working with their pair programming partner.  

In response to the question "*What are your favorite parts about the sprint?*"  
>- Pair programming
>- Getting to directly interact with sklearn's core contributors.
>- Working on issues and collaborating with my partner.
>- The amazing feeling of being part of a large community that cares.
>- Meeting people from different countries
>- Overall good arrangement + the presence of core-contributors to support through the whole process from setting the development environment to submitting and merging a PR
>- Meeting new people and getting to know core team 
>- Getting to meet the core contributors to sckit-learn. So helpful and friendly!
>- Pair programming, an Excellent sprint strategy
>- The communication with my pair programming partner
>- The community is great and friendly 
>- The pair programming and the feedback session with the core developers
>- There was ample knowledge to start working on things. It was very easy to get going with the shared information.
>- Working on an issue with a partner alongside a contributor. I got a better perspective on working on issues.
>- Getting help from the core contributors/developers and learning from my programming partner*

Some general feedback in the survey:  

>- I had a very good pair programming partner from a different country and profession. The sprint was planned very well. I definitely would love to participate in more of such sprints.
>- The experience was amazing and worth it I really learnt a lot and hopefully to keep up on working on more OS. Love the diversity and networking that comes along with am proud to have collaborated with my pair and contribution on the OS thank you for the great platform.

One suggestion for improvement:  
>- *Have single comprehensive source of information for preparing the environment.*

## Non-measurable Impact
Aside from the number of PRs that were merged, there is non-quantifiable impact of the open source sprint. Some examples include:
- learning to set up virtual environment
- using Git (fork, clone, branch, fetching another's PR)
- introduction to tests such as:  flake8 (linting, formatting), pytest, "continuous integration"
- navigating through the codebase structure of scikit-learn
- digging into functions, learning about errors
- learning about unit tests
- interacting with contributors on GitHub
- learning, in general
- networking
- building confidence (making a dent in "imposter syndrome")
- having fun

## Adjustments for Next Sprint

### Reviewing Pull Requests
Reviewing PRs will also be added on the list of issues that the sprint participants can work on. 

For sprint attendees who have submitted a PR, then can review other contributor's PRs and provide feedback.  

### scikit-learn branch: "master" to "main"
Include a note that scikit-learn has changed their default branch name from "master" to "main".  Currently all the videos and documentation refer to "master."

### Applicant Attrition
We typically observe 10% no-show rates for this type of online event.  For this event it was much higher.  For future sprints, we will do more outreach, aim for more applications so that overall turnout is about 40 attendees.
