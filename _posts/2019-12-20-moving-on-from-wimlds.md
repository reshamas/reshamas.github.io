When I joined WiMLDS in 2015, the NYC chapter was just a few months old, and there were only 2 chapters.  Now at the end of 2019, there are 80+ chapters, and it’s been wonderful to contribute to and observe the growth of WiMLDS. 

After 5 years as a WiMLDS organizer, global team and board member (WiMLDS contributions), I will be moving on in January 2020 to pursue other projects.  

## Moving on to:  URGs and Allies in Data Science
My next endeavor is exploring intersectional diversity (meaning considering dimensions of diversity outside of gender), beginning with **URGs and Allies in Data Science**:  
- Meetup:  [NYC URGs and Allies in Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/nyc-uads/)
- Twitter:  [@UrgsADS](https://twitter.com/urgsADS)
- LinkedIn:  [URGs and Allies in Data Science](www.linkedin.com/company/uads/)

## Lessons Learned
Being an organizer for the past 5 years has shaped my perspective on a number of aspects:  
- Thinking globally is important and imperative.
- Intersectional diversity (also referred to as covariance diversity) is worth considering and focusing on multiple dimensions of diversity could accordingly move all diversity initiatives forward.
- Welcoming and including allies is crucial in moving the needle on diversity outcomes.

## Contacting Me
I am easy to find on social media and my contact information is available on my [website](https://reshamas.github.io). 

Thank you to everyone for all your support over the years, and I look forward to crossing paths with you in the data science community.

## APPENDIX:  My WiMLDS Contributions (2015 to 2020)

These are contributions I have made to WiMLDS over the past 5 years.  

### New York Chapter of WiMLDS
- NYC chapter organizer 
    - organized dozens of meetup events and workshops over the course of 5 years:  [past NYC WiMLDS events](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-WiMLDS/events/past/)
- Mentored new organizers in 2018 and 2019
- Advisor to NYC WiMLDS from January 2015 to spring 2015, prior to joining as an organizer in spring 2015
- Co-organized [2018 WiMLDS/WiDS/SAP conference](https://events.sap.com/us/widsnyc2019/en/home)

### Scikit-learn Open Source Sprints
- Organized 5 scikit-learn sprints
    - NYC 2017
    - [NYC 2018](https://reshamas.github.io/highlights-from-the-2018-NYC-WiMLDS-scikit-sprint/)
    - [NYC 2019](https://medium.com/@kelly.carmody45/my-experience-at-the-2019-nyc-women-in-machine-learning-and-data-science-wimlds-scikit-learn-be776024ab7) 
    - [Nairobi 2019](https://reshamas.github.io/nairobi-wimlds-2019-scikit-learn-sprint-impact-report/)
    - [Bay Area 2019](https://sites.google.com/view/bay-area-wimlds-2019-sprint/home)
- Wrote Sprint Impact Reports (goal:  communicate our events, accomplishments and impact to community)
    - [Nairobi 2019 Sprint Impact Report](https://reshamas.github.io/nairobi-wimlds-2019-scikit-learn-sprint-impact-report/)
    - [NYC 2017-2018 Sprint Impact Report](https://reshamas.github.io/impact-report-for-wimlds-scikit-learn-sprints/)

I also wrote a comprehensive article on organizing open source sprints: [How to Organize a Scikit-learn Sprint](https://reshamas.github.io/how-to-organize-a-scikit-learn-sprint/) so other chapters can continue to organize.  I provided these resources to the Berlin WiMLDS chapter to organize their [Berlin 2020 sprint](https://sites.google.com/view/berlinscikitsprint/home).  

### Sponsorship
- Built relationship with sponsors over the course of 5 years which accounted for significant funding for WiMLDS
- Created and distributed Global Newsletter to increase resources and communication WiMLDS chapter organizers globally in 2019
- Was a guest on [DataFramed podcast](https://reshamas.github.io/dataframed-podcast/)
    - recorded in November 2018 and released in February 2019
    - resulted in increasing our chapters 50%, from 39 to 63 [WiMLDS Q1 report](https://reshamas.github.io/wimlds-2019-q1-report/) in less than 2 months
    
### Marketing
- Initiated the summary and reporting of WiMLDS chapter data to communicate our reach publicly:
    - [2019 Q1 report](https://reshamas.github.io/wimlds-2019-q1-report/)
    - [2018 Annual report](https://reshamas.github.io/wimlds-2018-annual-report/)
    - [October 2018 report:  initial report](https://reshamas.github.io/overview-of-wimlds-chapters/)
- Worked with local chapters to bring meetup chapters under WiMLDS ownership and tag the meetup groups so live statistics could easily be retrievable:  [Meetup WiMLDS MAP](https://www.meetup.com/topics/wimlds/)
- Presented at O'Reilly AI [NYC 2019 Better Together Diversity Luncheon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxJ-j38gcU)
- Implemented consistent "Welome Messages" for all meetup chapters so links to social media forums were directly accessible to increase followers on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and more.

### Global Chapters Support
- Recruited two new members to join global team from Europe and Kenya to increase global representation
- Created a "zap" on Zapier:  a system to manage new organizers (now over 150) to the meetup group and process their applications so they can be added to the wimlds website.  This improved efficiency, saved time and ensure more organizers were added to our website.
- Recruited and guided a volunteer to create and design our website.  This project was initiated and overseen by me in 2016.
- Created project to create [WiMLDS Overview Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N8O4iFNDHXHQFkizqcoVINvYeNt9_NlxhYqKVXHy1RU) so organizers worldwide would be able to share history and statistics about WiMLDS
- Created [5 Years (birthday) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnCc_XiOL_Q)
- Created [Conferences List](https://github.com/WiMLDS/conferences) for community
- Supported global chapters by responding to inquiries, processing payments, etc.
