## Deploying A Deep Learning Model on Mobile Using TensorFlow and React

This article was co-authored with Nidhin Pattaniyil.

We cover how to build a cross-platform mobile app (for both iOS and Android) using React Native and TensorFlowJS React Native adaptor.

As mobile phones have become more accessible, consequently, mobile use has been increasing. Users are utilizing mobile devices over desktop more frequently, and apps on mobile are in high demand. These internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to bring the inference models closer to the user.
