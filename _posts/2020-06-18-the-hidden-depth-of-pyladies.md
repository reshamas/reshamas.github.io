## Disclosure
It was a fairly manual process and it would be preferable if could be automated.  I tried using Facebook Graph API, but was not successful obtaining an API key.

## PyLadies History of Growth  
PyLadies communities has opened more chapters than other community in that space, and they are most broadly represented in the world.  There are also many chapters which are non-active.  

Some chapters were dissolved, or rolled into other communities such as:  Django Girls, Girl Develop It, general Python meetup groups, PyData meetup groups.

## Number of Members
As this was a rather manual process, the first step was identifying how many chapters there were.  Next steps would be to determine the membership in the "main platform" to ascertain how many members are in the community.
