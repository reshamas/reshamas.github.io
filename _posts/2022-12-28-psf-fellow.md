## 2022 PSF Fellow Announcement

I am happy to share that in July 2022 I was named a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation:  [Announcing Python Software Foundation Fellow Members for Q2 2022! ðŸŽ‰](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/07/announcing-python-software-foundation.html).  This is in recognition for my volunteer community contributions for the past 8 years.  

>The above members help support the Python ecosystem by being phenomenal leaders, sustaining the growth of the Python scientific community, maintaining virtual Python communities, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.
