## What is the estimated membership, by country?
Note:  While Brazil has the highest count, these statistic include the country-level chapter of "Brazil" which has almost 10000 members.  They would be double-counted with the Brazil city-level chapters. The total count of meetup members and social media followers is 117,000. Because of the country-level chapters and possible double-counting, the total number of PyLadies is estimated to be between 100,000 and 120,000.
