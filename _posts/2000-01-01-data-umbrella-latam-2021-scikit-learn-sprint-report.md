## Sprint Background
This "sprint" is a hands-on hackathon where participants learn to contribute to scikit-learn, a widely-used Python open source, machine learning library.

This sprint was organized by [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org) to increase the participation of underrepresented persons in data science, with a focus on the geographic region of Latin America (LATAM).  

This report focuses on the summary, impact and lessons learned of the Data Umbrella LATAM scikit-learn sprint.  

## Event Sponsor
This event was funded in part by a grant from Code for Science & Society, made possible by grant number [GBMF8449](https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF8449) from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

</p>


## Continued Contribution to Open Source
This sprint was a 4-hour block of time with pre- and post-sprint work required.

Participants were encouraged to keep contributing to scikit-learn or other Python libraries, using the skills learned in this event.


## Sprint Agenda
- 19-Jun-2021:  Pre-sprint Kickoff (11am - 1pm) (UTC-5)
- 26-Jun-2021:  Sprint  (11pm to 1pm) (UTC-5) 
- 10-Jul-2021:  Sprint Follow-up Office Hours (11am to 12pm) (UTC-5)

[a] UTC-5 = São Paulo, Brazil Time  

### Sprint Day
The sprint officially ran 4 hours, which is limited time to submit a PR.  The participants continued to work on their sprint PRs throughout the weekend.

### Follow-up Office Hours
Office hours were set up 2 weeks after the sprint where some of the scikit-learn core contributors were available to answer questions on open PRs.  


## Demographics

<p>
 <img src="../assets/images/2021-afme/afme-graphs.png" width="99%" height="99%" style="border:0px;margin:0px">

## Resources for Contributing to scikit-learn 
Because this was a virtual event and there is a limited capacity for being online for a full 8-hour day, a checklist was provided so folks could do preparation work at their own pace prior to the sprint.  

### Videos
Here are some videos in a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKcU7Ik-ir-b1fwjNabO3b8ebs9ez5ga) that provide useful information on contributing to scikit-learn.

Here is a [Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOnNUVs7Y-c3-CC4IEf42j8TSlP-UNFb53_lQZBvXEg/edit?usp=sharing) to begin contributing to scikit-learn.  Interested contributors can organize their own sprint, work with a pair programming partner or work on their own.

## Impact


### Non-measurable Impact
Aside from the number of PRs that were merged, there is non-quantifiable impact of the open source sprint. Some examples include:
- learning to set up virtual environment
- using Git (fork, clone, branch, fetching another's PR)
- introduction to tests such as:  flake8 (linting, formatting), pytest, "continuous integration"
- navigating through the codebase structure of scikit-learn
- digging into functions, learning about errors
- learning about unit tests
- interacting with contributors on GitHub
- learning, in general
- networking
- building confidence (making a dent in "imposter syndrome")
- having fun


### Documentation Impact
These are the statistics for the videos that are considered documentation:    
1.  Andreas Mueller: [Crash Course in Contributing to scikit-learn](https://youtu.be/5OL8XoMMOfA) 
  - Jan 1, 2021: 1100

3.  Reshama Shaikh: [Intro to Discord](https://youtu.be/w2A8SknM-68) 
  - Mar 7, 2021: 99 

Sprint outreach can be considered an impact.  Even if folks do not attend or apply, the sprint outreach brings more visibility and interest to the project.

## Contributing to Other Libraries Post-Sprint
One sprint participant used his open source skills to contribute to another Python library.

## Challenges

### Videos
The videos that were created can be quickly outdated compared to static print. Videos are more accessible, but also take more effort to create.

Some of the video content created is outdated.  A few of the following items need to be updated:  
- branch on GitHub repo changed from `master` to `main` in January 2021
- instructions for setting up virtual environment has been updated in the past year
- 


## Adjustments for Next Sprint

### Reviewing Pull Requests
Reviewing PRs will also be added on the list of issues that the sprint participants can work on. 

For sprint attendees who have submitted a PR, then can review other contributor's PRs and provide feedback.  

### Video: Reviewing PRs
Create a video that shows how contributors can review PRs with tips.  

### scikit-learn branch: "master" to "main"
Include a note that scikit-learn has changed their default branch name from "master" to "main".  Currently all the videos and documentation refer to "master."

### Applicant Attrition
We typically observe 10% no-show rates for this type of online event.  For this event it was much higher.  For future sprints, we will do more outreach, aim for more applications so that overall turnout is about 40 attendees.

### #DataUmbrella Hashtag 
Reminder to sprint participants to include this hashtag #DataUmbrella on their pull requests so we can track them.

### Post any questions on #help_queue channel on Discord
A number of sprint participants were waiting alone at their virtual table.  They did not proactively join the #help_queue channel to let us know their pair programming partner was not present.  We should include a reminder for this in our email communications and intro presentation.

### Time of Event
Due to availability of the lead organizer and scikit-learn core contributor, the sprint began at 8am WET (Western European Time), which was 8am Nigeria / West Africa time.  That is likely too early for a Saturday event.  Schedule event so focused participants begin at 9am or 10am at the earliest.


## Sprint Feedback

Feedback has been shared a number of ways:  
- Twitter [Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1358408128753238017)
- Blogs
- Sprint survey
- Social media (LinkedIn)
- Casually, in conversation during the sprint, pre-sprint and post-sprint events

## Data Umbrella Feedback Survey
Data Umbrella received 21 responses to our internal sprint survey. (21/31 = 68% response rate).

Respondents rated their overall sprint experience highly favorably and had a positive experience working with their pair programming partner.  

In response to the question "*What are your favorite parts about the sprint?*"  
>- Pair programming
>- Getting to directly interact with sklearn's core contributors.
>- Working on issues and collaborating with my partner.
>- The amazing feeling of being part of a large community that cares.
>- Meeting people from different countries
>- Overall good arrangement + the presence of core-contributors to support through the whole process from setting the development environment to submitting and merging a PR
>- Meeting new people and getting to know core team 
>- Getting to meet the core contributors to sckit-learn. So helpful and friendly!
>- Pair programming, an Excellent sprint strategy
>- The communication with my pair programming partner
>- The community is great and friendly 
>- The pair programming and the feedback session with the core developers
>- There was ample knowledge to start working on things. It was very easy to get going with the shared information.
>- Working on an issue with a partner alongside a contributor. I got a better perspective on working on issues.
>- Getting help from the core contributors/developers and learning from my programming partner
>- discussing details of technical problems and solutions in small groups on discord / github

Some general feedback in the survey:  

>- I had a very good pair programming partner from a different country and profession. The sprint was planned very well. I definitely would love to participate in more of such sprints.
>- The experience was amazing and worth it I really learnt a lot and hopefully to keep up on working on more OS. Love the diversity and networking that comes along with am proud to have collaborated with my pair and contribution on the OS thank you for the great platform.

One suggestion for improvement:  
>- *Have single comprehensive source of information for preparing the environment.*
