## Accessible COVID-19 statistics tracker
- [Accessible COVID-19 statistics tracker](https://cvstats.net/#page-top)
    - [Alternate Formats](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/how-info/what-are-alternate-formats)
>For many people with disabilities, much of the data available regarding the COVID19 (coronavirus) outbreak is in a graphical format, which is impossible to access. It is my hope that this site can serve to solve the lack of information by making critical statistics available in a text format that is easy to read and understand.

>Persons with disabilities often use adaptive/assistive technology that require an alternate/accessible format so the technology can access the information in a specific manner for the user.

## Data
- JH GitHub repository: [COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- AWS: [A public data lake for analysis of COVID-19 data](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/)
>Hosted on the AWS cloud, we have seeded our curated data lake with COVID-19 case tracking data from Johns Hopkins and The New York Times, hospital bed availability from Definitive Healthcare, and over 45,000 research articles about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses from the Allen Institute for AI.

- [Data API](https://covidtracking.com/api/)
- [CORD 19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research)
- Chan Zuckerberg [Open research dataset](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/new-dataset-makes-coronavirus-research-open-and-machine-readable/)  COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD), a collection of 29,000 articles (13,000 full text) covering coronaviruses, related viruses, and research on our very own novel SARS-CoV-2.
- Panacea Lab: [COVID19 Tweets (millions)](http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/) Georgia State University
>dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020) contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day.

- Google Cloud hosted [COVID19 data](cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/free-public-datasets-for-covid19)
>To aid researchers, data scientists, and analysts in the effort to combat COVID-19, we are making a hosted repository of public datasets, like Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), the Global Health Data from the World Bank, and OpenStreetMap data, free to access and query through our COVID-19 Public Dataset Program. Researchers can also use BigQuery ML to train advanced machine learning models with this data right inside BigQuery at no additional cost.

>The Open Ventilator Registry is calling on software engineers to help build a platform for hospitals to report on their stock of ventilators and if they have a surplus or deficit. Hospitals with a surplus can then send their supply to hospitals in greatest need. We aim to create a nimble and decentralized supply chain and distribution network of these life saving devices.
