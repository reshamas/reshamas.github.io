## Diversity 
These are the stages of the current conversation on diversity:  
1.  **What** is diversity?
2.  **Why** is it important? ([demographic representation](http://www.diversitywoman.com/why-diversity-matters/) & [good for business](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/diverse-teams-are-still-really-good-for-business-mckinsey-says/))
3.  **Where** to find candidates and make my organization diverse?
4.  **How** to [retain employees](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996) from underrepresented groups?

The focus of this post is to share a comprehensive list of resources for women and non-binary people in data science for the goal of increasing diversity in the workplace.  



## Purpose

There has been extensive research which shows that women are:
- [underrepresented in tech](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-02/why-so-few-women-break-through-tech-s-bro-culture-quicktake-q-a) and the [statistics are severely imbalanced](http://observer.com/2017/06/women-in-tech-statistics/)
- [lagging in senior positions](https://research.hackerrank.com/women-in-tech/2018/)
- [paid inequitably](https://careerswiki.com/publications/gender-pay-gap-statistics/)
- [experiencing sexism](https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/897600522722705408)   

Some positive news is that research has shown that networking events for women *do indeed* [move the needle on equality](https://hbr.org/2018/02/do-womens-networking-events-move-the-needle-on-equality).

This guide was created to provide a resource for women and non-binary individuals in data science to accomplish the following in a friendly and supportive environment:  
- building community
- networking 
- developing skills, education
- sharing knowledge
- finding jobs
- advancing their careers
- advocating for themselves and others

### Male Allies
This resource will also be valuable to **male allies** who seek to diversify their organization, by **proactively**:   
- supporting and amplifying women
- finding women speakers for conferences
- recruiting women candidates for jobs

## Guidelines for Engagement

- <span style="color:orange"> **Code of Conduct:** </span>  read the CoC of the organization
- <span style="color:orange"> **Membership:** </span>  some of the organizations are open solely to women and non-binary people. Others are open to male allies.  Be informed and respectful of their membership requirements before joining.

## Women in Open Source

Women are overwhelmingly [underrepresented in open source](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/111/and-now-an-infuriating-statistic-about-women-and-coding/).  Here is a twitter list of [Women in Open Source](https://twitter.com/reshamas/lists/women-in-open-source/members) which was inspired by this [twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/wimlds/status/972005489771921416).


## Examples of Amplifying Women in Data

Here are some examples of how to bring visibility to women and non-binary people in the data space: 
- RLadies: [tweet stream on International Women's Day (IWD)](https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018)
- Women in Statistics:  [Twitter hashtag #statswomen](https://twitter.com/hashtag/statswomen)

In honor of Women's History Month, we are celebrating several ASA women who work in statistics and data science. These accomplished women were chosen because they inspired and influenced other women in their field. [Read their biographies](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/03/01/wis/) to learn why they chose statistics, who influenced them, and what all they have accomplished.
