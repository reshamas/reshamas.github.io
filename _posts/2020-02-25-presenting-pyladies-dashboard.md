## Team
- Developer: Ben Ubah
- Project Manager:  Reshama Shaikh

## Tools
- **Front-end:** Pure HTML / JavaScript, D3.js, Echarts.js, Leaflet.js, Gentellala dashboard template
- **Back-end:** A small ETL infrastructure based on R, Bash and Travis CI that daily retrieves data from Meetup API. The use of this tool is based on previous work for a similar R-Ladies dashboard. This infrastructure provides a way to work with Meetup's OAUTH 2.0 authentication system automatically. The back-end is completely separated from the front-end. 

## Sponsors
We are looking for sponsors to fiscally support this project and maintenance of this project in exchange for displaying your organization’s name in the Sponsor section of the dashboard page.  Email us for more information.  

## The Long Term Goal
