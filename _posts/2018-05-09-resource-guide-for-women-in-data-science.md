## Diversity 
These are the stages of the current conversation on diversity:  
1.  **What** is diversity?
2.  **Why** is it important? ([demographic representation](http://www.diversitywoman.com/why-diversity-matters/) & [good for business](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/diverse-teams-are-still-really-good-for-business-mckinsey-says/))
3.  **Where** to find candidates and make my organization diverse?
4.  **How** to [retain employees](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996) from underrepresented groups?

The focus of this post is to share a comprehensive list of resources for women in data science for the goal of increasing diversity in the workplace.  

## Purpose

There has been extensive research that shows women are [lagging in senior positions](https://research.hackerrank.com/women-in-tech/2018/) and [sexism exists](https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/897600522722705408) in the workplace.  The good news is that research has shown that networking events for women *do indeed* [move the needle on equality](https://hbr.org/2018/02/do-womens-networking-events-move-the-needle-on-equality).

This guide was created to provide a resource for women in data science to accomplish the following in a friendly and supportive environment:  
- networking 
- building skills, education
- finding jobs
- advancing their careers

This resource will also be valuable to **male allies** who seek to diversify their organization, primarily to:   
- support and amplify women
- find women speakers for conferences
- recruit women candidates for jobs

## Guidelines for Engagement
Prior to joining any of the organizations or attending any events, it is imperative to become familiar with these details:  
- **Mission:**  read the mission statement of the organization
- **Code of Conduct (CoC):**  read the CoC of the organization
- **Membership:**  some of the organizations are open to women and non-binary. Others are open to male allies.  Be informed and respectful of their membership requirements before joining.
