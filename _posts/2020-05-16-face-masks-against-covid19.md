My involvement in this project began in late March with reviewing publications and putting together a Summary of Studies. 

The article, with 19 co-authors, was published in April with a revision in May, entitled [Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review](www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/)

## Takeaway
**Wear a face mask to reduce the spread of COVID-19.**
