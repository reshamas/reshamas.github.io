This project began in late March, and my involvement began with reviewing masks publications to determine whether masks could provide utility in preventing COVID-19. 

The article, with 19 co-authors, was published in April with a revision in May, entitled [Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review](www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/).

## Takeaway
**Wear a face mask to reduce the spread of COVID-19.**
