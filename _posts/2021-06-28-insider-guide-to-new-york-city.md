# Where To Go When Visiting New York¬†City
As a resident of New York City, I am often asked what places I would recommend to visitors. Here is a list of my favorites.

There are the well-known tourist attractions which I will not delve into too deeply, as they are available in most tour guides. Examples include: Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park, etc.¬†

Coming up is a list of favorite places in NYC of mine and my friends.

The extraordinary centerpiece of Hudson Yards is its spiral staircase, a soaring new landmark.

>For over 200 years, the grounds of the Basilica of St. Patrick‚Äôs Old Cathedral have been used as thefinal resting place for the faithful departed. The Basilica‚Äôs historic cemetery and underground catacombs have been a silent witness to the many struggles and accomplishments of prominent New York Catholics. It is where bishops rest beside noteworthy New Yorkers who have played important roles in New York, American, and Catholic history. Due to the lack of space, this practice was suspended.
