As a resident of New York City, I am often asked what places I would recommend to visitors. Here is a list of my favorites.

There are the well-known tourist attractions which I will not delve into too deeply, as they are available in most tour guides. Examples include: Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park, etc. 

Coming up is a list of favorite places in NYC of mine and my friends.

If you are coming from the Museum's Main Building, you may also take the M4 bus directly from Madison Avenue/83rd Street to the last stop. (Please allow more time for this option.)

### [Basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral: historic cemetery and nderground catacombs](https://oldcathedral.org/cemetery)

>For over 200 years, the grounds of the Basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral have been used as thefinal resting place for the faithful departed. The Basilica’s historic cemetery and underground catacombs have been a silent witness to the many struggles and accomplishments of prominent New York Catholics. It is where bishops rest beside noteworthy New Yorkers who have played important roles in New York, American, and Catholic history. Due to the lack of space, this practice was suspended. 


### [The Morgan Library and Museum](https://www.themorgan.org)
- The [Morgan Library & Museum](https://www.newyorkjourney.com/attractions-the-morgan-library-museum.htm) was established in New York City by J.P. Morgan, a prominent businessman and philanthropist. This complex includes an extensive permanent collection of rare books, drawings and printed materials dating back to ancient times. Most of the items on display are derived from Morgan's private collection that was acquired through auctions and other exclusive transactions.
